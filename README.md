# Integrated financial Report of bicycle sales

## Project Overview:
Welcome to the Advanced Financial Analysis of Bike Sales project. This comprehensive analysis leverages advanced data analytics and strategic financial modeling to transform raw bike sales data into actionable insights. 
#### My approach includes meticulous research and carefully crafted assumptions, ensuring the project's financial integration mirrors real-world scenarios.


## Key Highlights:

### Data Precision (PDF File)
#### 1/ Corrected Financial Data: 
Usage of DAX functions to rectify discrepancies in profit, cost, and revenue raw columns, ensuring data accuracy.
#### 2/ Geographic Accuracy: 
Raw data inconsistencies (e.g., "Nord" in Burkina Faso, not France) for accurate geographic analysis.
#### 3/ Date Table: 
Created a comprehensive Date Table using DAX.

### Strategic Financial Integration (PDF File)
#### 1/ Financial Metrics: 
Integrated financial data, forecasting Fixed Expenses with a 5% annual increase. Calculated precise KPIs such as Break-even Point and Net Profit Margin.
#### 1/ Research and Assumptions: 
Conducted detailed research on Fixed and Operating Expenses for subcategories, acknowledging real-world variations while maintaining a robust conceptual framework.
#### 1/ Variable Expenses: 
Applied differentiated expense ratios based on product categories and countries to reflect actual financial dynamics.

### Key Performance Indicators (PDF File)
#### Gross Profit: Revenue - Cost Price
Gross profit represents the amount of money your company makes from selling goods or services after deducting the direct costs of producing them. It's a fundamental indicator of your business's profitability.
#### Gross Profit Margin: (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100
Gross profit margin shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold. It indicates how efficiently your company is producing and selling its products or services.
#### Markup Percentage: ((Sales Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price) × 100
Markup percentage shows how much the sales price exceeds the cost price as a percentage of the cost price. It's useful for pricing decisions.
#### Net Profit: Revenue - (Cost Price + Operating Expenses)
Net profit represents the total amount of money your company has left after deducting all expenses, including both the cost of goods sold and operating expenses.
#### Net Profit Margin: (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100
Net profit margin indicates the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses have been deducted. It provides a comprehensive view of your business's profitability.
#### Break-even Point: Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)
The break-even point represents the number of units you need to sell to cover all your costs. It's a critical metric for financial planning and decision-making.

### Insights
#### Profit Analysis: 
Identified 2015 as the highest net profit year, with Q2 and June as peak periods.
#### Country and Age Group: 
Determined the USA as the highest net profit country and Adults (35-64) as the most profitable age group.
#### Product Performance: 
Highlighted mountain bikes, helmets, and mountain shorts as top performers.
#### Recommendations: 
Suggested removing "Jerseys" due to high costs and low profits, and a slight price increase for "Caps" to enhance profitability.
