# Integrated financial analysis of bicycle sales

## Project Overview:
Welcome to the Advanced Financial Analysis of Bike Sales project. This comprehensive analysis leverages advanced data analytics and strategic financial modeling to transform raw bike sales data into actionable insights. 
#### My approach includes meticulous research and carefully crafted assumptions, ensuring the project's financial integration mirrors real-world scenarios.


## Key Highlights:

### Data Precision
#### 1/ Corrected Financial Data: 
Usage of DAX functions to rectify discrepancies in profit, cost, and revenue raw columns, ensuring data accuracy.
#### 2/ Geographic Accuracy: 
Raw data inconsistencies (e.g., "Nord" in Burkina Faso, not France) for accurate geographic analysis.
#### 3/ Date Table: 
Created a comprehensive Date Table using DAX.
#### 4/ Demographic Trends: 
Analyzed trends to identify top-profit countries and high-value age groups, informing targeted marketing strategies.

### Strategic Financial Integration
#### 1/ Financial Metrics: 
Integrated financial data, forecasting Fixed Expenses with a 5% annual increase. Calculated precise KPIs such as Break-even Point and Net Profit Margin.
#### 1/ Research and Assumptions: 
Conducted detailed research on Fixed and Operating Expenses for subcategories, acknowledging real-world variations while maintaining a robust conceptual framework.
#### 1/ Variable Expenses: 
Applied differentiated expense ratios based on product categories and countries to reflect actual financial dynamics.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
#### Gross Profit: Revenue - Cost Price
#### Gross Profit Margin: (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100
#### Markup Percentage: ((Sales Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price) × 100
#### Net Profit: Revenue - (Cost Price + Operating Expenses)
#### Net Profit Margin: (Net Profit / Revenue) × 100
#### Break-even Point: Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)

### Insights
#### Profit Analysis: 
Identified 2015 as the highest net profit year, with Q2 and June as peak periods.
#### Country and Age Group: 
Determined the USA as the highest net profit country and Adults (35-64) as the most profitable age group.
#### Product Performance: 
Highlighted mountain bikes, helmets, and mountain shorts as top performers.
#### Recommendations: 
Suggested removing "Jerseys" due to high costs and low profits, and a slight price increase for "Caps" to enhance profitability.















1/ Data Precision and DAX Mastery:
Rectified discrepancies in crucial columns (profit, cost, revenue) using advanced DAX functions, ensuring precise and reliable data.
Utilized intricate DAX structures to recalculate variable expenses based on revenue ratios, providing in-depth financial insights.

2/ Geographic and Demographic Insights:
Resolved data inconsistencies, ensuring accurate geographic analysis, including correcting "Nord" representing Burkina Faso, not France.
Analyzed demographic trends, identifying top-profit countries and high-value age groups, guiding targeted marketing strategies.

3/ Strategic Financial Integration:
Integrated financial data, forecasting Fixed Expenses with a 5% annual increase, and calculated precise KPIs, including the Break-even Point and Net Profit Margin.
Conducted detailed research to identify Fixed Expenses and Operating Expenses for subcategories, recognizing real-world variations while maintaining the underlying conceptual framework.
Explored detailed financial metrics, offering a granular view of operational efficiency and profitability.

4/ In-Depth Market Analysis:
Identified high-profit categories and products, offering actionable insights for market optimization.
Discovered significant disparities in subcategories like "Jerseys," where high costs and low profits indicate the need for removal due to inadequate demand and very high production cost.
Evaluated the "Caps" subcategory, recognizing its acceptable performance. Recommended a slight price increase to enhance profitability given its higher production cost.

5/ YOY Net Profit Analysis (2011-2016):
Conducted extensive YOY net profit analysis, enabling trend mapping and data-driven decision-making.
